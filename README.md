Python repository for the paper "Learning Tree-structured Distributions". It contains the implementation of the two following Online Learning algorithms: 


1. **[Online Forest Density Estimation](https://www.auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/116.pdf)**  
   Frédéric Koriche. *UAI 2016*.

2. **[Distribution Learning Meets Graph Structure Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07914)**  
   Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Philips George John, Sayantan Sen, and N. V. Vinodchandran. *arXiv 2024*.

It also includes an implementation of the classic Chow-Liu algorithm and evaluation metrics that were used in the paper, specifically, log-likelihood and structural hamming distance (SHD) computations.
